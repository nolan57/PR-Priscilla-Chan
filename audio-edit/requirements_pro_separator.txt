# Core dependencies
PyQt6>=6.4.0
numpy>=1.21.0
scipy>=1.7.0
soundfile>=0.10.0
sounddevice>=0.4.0
librosa>=0.9.0
julius>=0.2.0  # Required for UVR Demucs implementation

# PyTorch ecosystem
torch>=1.12.0
torchaudio>=0.12.0

# Audio processing and conversion
ffmpeg-python>=0.2.0

# Machine learning and AI components
speechbrain>=0.5.0
onnxruntime>=1.10.0
huggingface-hub>=0.12.0  # Required for offline model loading

# Advanced audio separation models (optional but recommended)
# demucs>=4.0.0  # Uncomment if you have sufficient RAM (8GB+ recommended)
# openai-whisper>=20231106  # Uncomment for precise timestamp detection

# System Requirements and UVR Integration:
# - FFmpeg must be installed and accessible in PATH
# - 8GB+ RAM recommended for Demucs processing
# - GPU recommended for Whisper (CPU works but slower)
# - UVR components automatically loaded from local ultimatevocalremovergui folder
# - lib_v5 and core modules provide advanced vocal separation algorithms

# Installation notes:
# 1. Install system FFmpeg first
# 2. pip install -r requirements_pro_separator.txt
# 3. For Demucs support: pip install demucs
# 4. For Whisper support: pip install openai-whisper
# 5. Ensure ultimatevocalremovergui folder is present for UVR integration
