# Professional Singer Voice Separator Requirements

# Core dependencies (same as singer_cleaner.py)
PyQt6>=6.4.0
numpy>=1.21.0
scipy>=1.7.0
soundfile>=0.10.0
sounddevice>=0.4.0
librosa>=0.9.0
julius>=0.2.0  # Required for UVR Demucs implementation

# PyTorch (CPU version recommended for most users)
torch>=1.12.0
torchaudio>=0.12.0

# Audio processing
ffmpeg-python>=0.2.0

# Speaker recognition
speechbrain>=0.5.0

# Optional advanced models (install if available)
# demucs>=4.0.0  # Uncomment if you have sufficient RAM (8GB+ recommended)
# openai-whisper>=20231106  # Uncomment for precise timestamp detection

# Integration with Ultimate Vocal Remover components:
# The application can use local Demucs implementation from ultimatevocalremovergui
# No additional installation required if UVR is available locally

# System dependencies:
# - FFmpeg must be installed and accessible in PATH
# - For Demucs: 8GB+ RAM recommended
# - For Whisper: GPU recommended but CPU works (slower)

# Installation notes:
# 1. Install system FFmpeg first
# 2. pip install -r requirements_pro_separator.txt
# 3. For Demucs support: pip install demucs
# 4. For Whisper support: pip install openai-whisper
#
# Integration benefits:
# - Uses proven Demucs implementation from UVR project
# - Leverages advanced spectral processing utilities
# - Benefits from UVR's extensive testing and optimization
# - Maintains compatibility with existing UVR workflows
