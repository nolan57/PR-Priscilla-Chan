# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Analyze and document the PCS directory containing AI/ML projects focused on audio processing, singing voice synthesis, and speech technology, creating a comprehensive QWEN.md file for future reference.

## Key Knowledge
- The PCS directory contains multiple interconnected projects centered around DiffSinger singing voice synthesis
- Key components include: DiffSinger (main synthesis engine), dataset-tools (audio processing and labeling), MakeDiffSinger (dataset creation pipelines), Montreal-Forced-Aligner (speech alignment), LyricFA (lyrics alignment), HKCantonese_models (Cantonese-specific models), and ultimatevocalremovergui (vocal separation)
- The workflow typically involves data preparation → alignment → labeling → model training → synthesis → post-processing
- Most projects use Python/PyTorch with some C++/Qt components for GUI applications
- The projects support multiple languages including Chinese and Cantonese with specialized models

## Recent Actions
- Successfully analyzed all major directories in the PCS collection
- Read and interpreted README files from key projects (DiffSinger, dataset-tools, MakeDiffSinger, Montreal-Forced-Aligner, ultimatevocalremovergui, LyricFA, HKCantonese_models)
- Identified the purpose and interconnections between different tools in the ecosystem
- Created a comprehensive QWEN.md file documenting the entire collection of audio processing projects

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Analyze directory structure and key files
- [DONE] Read README files from major projects
- [DONE] Understand the relationships between different tools
- [DONE] Create comprehensive QWEN.md documentation
- [DONE] Document the workflow and technical stack
- [DONE] Complete project summary
