# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Analyze the Ultimate Vocal Remover GUI project and create comprehensive documentation for future reference.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.8+, PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, various audio processing libraries
- **Project Structure**: Contains core modules (models, ensemble, utils, config), separation engines (VR, MDX-Net, Demucs), and model management
- **Processing Methods**: Three main architectures - VR (Vocal Remover), MDX-Net (TFC-TDF networks), and Demucs (multi-stem separation)
- **Architecture**: CLI-based application with extensive configuration options and model management
- **Model Directories**: VR models in `models/VR_Models/`, MDX models in `models/MDX_Net_Models/`, Demucs models in `models/Demucs_Models/v3_v4_repo/`
- **Dependencies**: Managed via `requirements.txt`, includes PyTorch, ONNX, audio processing libraries
